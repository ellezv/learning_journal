# Learning Journal


This is a learning journal blog-like application.  
It was created using Pyramid sqlAlchemy.  

Right now it needs a lot more tests but it has some cool features


## Features:
- a sqlite database to persist posts
- display posts list in home page
- each post has a detail page
- you can create new posts
- you can edit existing posts


## Deployment:
It is deployed on Heroku at http://maellevance.herokuapp.com
One problem is that Heroku uses an ephemeral file system that refreshes our database often.
In the future we plan on using a postgresql database for that reason.
